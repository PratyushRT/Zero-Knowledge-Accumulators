# Zero-Knowledge-Accumulators
This is a C and C++ based implementation of the Asiacrypt(2015) paper titled "Zero-Knowledge Accumulators and Set Operations". Pairing based operation are enabled by the PBC library in C and big integer arithmetic enabled by the NTL library in C++. This is a small part of my ongoing thesis at Ashoka University.
